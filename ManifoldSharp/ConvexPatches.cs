// ConvexPatches.cs — NOT A PORT; part of divergence ledger entry 6 (ConvexDilation.cs).
// Stage B of the dilation tree: adjacent triangles are grouped into patches P so one
// hull, hull(P ⊕ B) = hull(P) ⊕ B, replaces |P| per-triangle hulls. DILATION ONLY.
//
// ── Why a patch hull is sound ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The dilation is solid ⊕ B. hull(P) ⊕ B ⊆ solid ⊕ B whenever H = hull(P) ⊆ solid
// (closed), and it covers every t ⊕ B for t in P, so swapping the |P| hulls for one
// leaves the union the same set - up to QuickHull's epsilon: a point within
// DefaultEps × extent of a face is dropped from a hull, so each computed hull, patch or
// per-triangle, can only shrink, never add material. The patched and per-triangle trees
// therefore drift apart only by such dropped slivers, which is why their volumes are
// compared at 1e-9 rather than bit for bit. A patch is accepted only when three exact checks
// prove H ⊆ solid, for a solid that is a closed, embedded, outward-oriented manifold
// with boundary surface S:
//   (1) Supporting faces: for every triangle t of P, every vertex of P is on or below
//       t's plane (Filtered.Orient3d, never Pos), and at least one is strictly below.
//       So t's plane supports H with H on the inward side, and t ⊂ ∂H; the strict
//       vertex makes t non-degenerate and gives H volume (a flat patch is refused -
//       a flat L's hull would cover the notch, and nothing below could see it).
//   (2) Guard: every triangle T of S outside P misses int H, shown by one face plane
//       of the computed hull with all three of T's corners on or above it (or T's own
//       plane with every P vertex on one closed side). The hull's faces are first
//       checked exactly to have every P vertex on or below them and at least one
//       strictly below, so each face is a real plane (a zero-area face would put every
//       point at zero and wave any T through) and int H lies in its open lower
//       halfspace whatever the hull's rounding.
//       A triangle no face separates (a real crossing or a tangency the test cannot
//       certify) refuses the patch. Candidates come from the solid's collider,
//       queried with the patch's box (H lies in it).
//   Then S ∩ int H = ∅: triangles outside P by (2), triangles of P by (1) (they lie
//   on ∂H). int H is open, convex and so connected, and misses S, so it is wholly
//   inside or wholly outside the solid. Just below the relative interior of any t in
//   P lies int H (t is 2D in a supporting face of the 3D body H) and also the solid
//   (t's outward normal). So int H ⊆ solid and H = closure(int H) ⊆ solid.
// Condition (1) implies every dihedral inside P is convex, but is stronger: a helical
// strip of convex edges fails it. Any failure puts the patch's triangles back as
// singletons, so doubt only costs speed.
//
// Why not erosion: the erosion tree subtracts ⋃ (t ⊕ B) = ∂A ⊕ B, and hull(P) ⊕ B is a
// superset that also contains int H ⊕ B - material the answer keeps. Not sound.
//
// ── Why the guard stays on the CPU ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// A GPU version of the guard was considered and dropped: patch building and the guard
// cost 3-7% of a patched run (Release, Thingi10K 40915/42041/40984), so a GPU filter
// could save at most a few percent.
//
// ── Determinism ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Sequential and a function of the mesh alone: seeds in triangle-index order, growth
// breadth-first across paired halfedges in halfedge order, each candidate taken or
// left by exact predicates. The unit list (patches and refused singletons) is in seed
// order, so the tree built on it is shaped by the input alone.
