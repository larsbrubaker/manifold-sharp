// ConvexDilation.cs — NOT A PORT. manifold-rust dilates a non-convex solid by a convex
// tool in Minkowski.cs's middle branch: one hull per triangle, then CsgTree.BatchUnion
// 1000 hulls at a time. This file answers the same question with the same hulls but a
// different reduction, and it is divergence ledger entry 6 (docs/RUST_DIVERGENCES.md)
// — an ADDED entry point, reached only when a caller asks for it by name.
// `Minkowski.Compute` is not routed through it and does not know it exists, so every
// ported path still produces the Rust's bits.
//
// ── Why a different reduction ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
// BatchBoolean pops the largest-vertex mesh first, so within a batch the growing union
// is always one operand: the batch is a serial chain absorbing one group after
// another, and ~85% of a dilation's time is spent there with every core but one idle.
// The hulls are the cheap part. Measured on a 2642-triangle part: 13.3 s through the
// ported path against 2.96 s here, identical volume. A single-threaded balanced tree
// was NOT faster — the gain is the parallelism a balanced tree exposes, not the shape.
//
// ── The tree ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//   1. Leaves: the solid on its own, then runs of LeafSize hull units in seed order,
//      a unit being one triangle or, when dilating, a convex patch whose one hull
//      replaces its triangles' (ConvexPatches.cs proves it lies in the dilation),
//      each leaf building its units' hulls as Minkowski.cs does (same vertex-sum
//      order) and unioning them through the CSG tree (the same BatchUnion
//      the ported path uses, on a batch small enough that its serial chain is short).
//      Hulls live only inside their leaf, so memory is bounded by the leaves in
//      flight, not by the triangle count.
//   2. Pairwise levels: node k of a level is the union of nodes 2k and 2k+1 of the
//      level below; an odd last node is carried up unchanged. Each level is one map.
//
// ── Determinism: the proof every parallel site carries ──────────────────────────
// The leaf map and every level map go through Progress.MaybeParMapCtProgress →
// Par.MaybeParMapCt, so
// the MANIFOLD_PARALLEL switch (ManifoldParallel.Enabled) governs them as it governs
// the other sites, and with it off this file runs sequentially. With it on, each
// worker writes result[i] for its own i and reads only the two input meshes (leaves)
// or the previous level's array, which is complete and never written again once its
// map has returned. The boolean engine is read once, before the tree, and every union
// in it - leaf and level alike - runs on that engine. The tree's
// shape is a function of the input mesh alone (patches are grown sequentially by exact
// predicates, ConvexPatches.cs), and every node's operands are
// fixed by index, so the booleans a parallel run performs are the booleans a
// sequential run performs, on the same inputs in the same operand order — the answer
// is the same bits whatever the threads do.
//
// The one exception is the one Minkowski.cs's header already documents for its hull
// map: each hull and each boolean mints mesh IDs from the process-global counter, and
// in parallel they are taken in worker order rather than index order. Those IDs are
// opaque handles that reach no geometry and no topology, and the closing
// InitializeOriginal replaces them with one fresh ID anyway, exactly as Minkowski.cs
// finishes. ParallelismTests.ConvexDilationGeometryIsBitIdenticalInParallel measures it.
//
// ── Erosion: the same tree, minus the solid ─────────────────────────────────────
// Minkowski.cs's inset branch computes A \ (boundary(A) ⊕ B) from the very same
// per-triangle hulls, finishing with a BatchBoolean Subtract of their batch unions from
// A (ConvexErosion.cs's header covers the sign convention). TryComputeErosion is that
// with this file's reduction: the hull leaves WITHOUT the solid leaf, reduced by the
// same tree, then one solid − union on the same engine. One routine (TryReduce) serves
// both, so the two cannot drift apart. The determinism argument above carries over
// unchanged: the leaf and level maps are the same maps over an index set that is a
// function of the triangle count alone, and the closing subtraction is one boolean run
// after the tree has returned, on fixed operands, outside any parallel map. Its
// agreement with Minkowski.Difference is on volume and genus, for the reason below.
// Unlike dilation it takes a convex solid (the ported erosion sweeps those too).
//
// ── Nested and crossing shells ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Shells that nest or cross with the same orientation wind 2 where they overlap, which
// the exact engine's unions are not defined for. That can only happen where two
// components' bounding boxes overlap, so when any pair does (HasOverlappingComponents, a
// sort and sweep on X), the robust engine's RebuildWithRule(Positive) first turns the
// solid into the union of its shells, and the tree reduces that; a rebuild that is not a
// clean manifold declines. No classification is attempted: a clean hollow or interlocked
// part rebuilds to the same solid. The rebuild is one sequential call before any map. For
// erosion the union is also the answer a user means: the raw sweep would carve an inner
// shell's boundary out of material the union keeps.
//
// ── Progress from inside the top unions ─────────────────────────────────────────
// Each union is one unit, so a top-level union that runs for seconds would hold the
// bar still. Levels of at most SubProgressMaxPairs unions (and erosion's closing
// subtraction) therefore hand each exact boolean a stage sink (BooleanStageProgress.cs)
// feeding one NodeProgress per level, which reports the level's finished nodes plus
// every running node's fraction as fractional units through ReportUnits. Monotone even
// with the level's unions in parallel: every stage and completion lands under the
// tracker's lock and only a value above the last one is reported; a node's fraction
// only grows and is replaced by its whole unit when it finishes, so no node exceeds
// its unit. Those levels advance the reporter's counter only after their map returns,
// so no Advance report can race the tracker. The sink is a side channel: the booleans
// compute the same bits (Union's remarks). Wider levels report per node as before.
//
// ── What it is not ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Not bit-identical to Minkowski.Sum. Union is associative on the solid, not on the
// mesh: reducing the same hulls in a different order rounds intersection vertices
// differently and triangulates differently. Volume and genus agree to roundoff —
// ConvexDilationTests pins it. (An earlier measurement showed a 2.6e-7 relative
// drift on an 11916-triangle part; that was a DedupeEdges defect, shared with the
// C++ and fixed in both ports (EdgeOp.Dedupe.cs, manifold-rust 4a99dc4), dropping
// solid out of one union node — not the reduction order.)
// Triangle lists do not agree, which is why this is a separate entry point rather
// than a reroute.
